ML Project: Predictive Maintenance
Introduction
This project focuses on predictive maintenance using machine learning techniques. Predictive maintenance involves forecasting equipment failures before they occur, allowing for timely maintenance and reducing downtime.

Requirements
Make sure you have the following installed:

Python (>=3.6)
pandas
numpy
tensorflow
matplotlib
scikit-learn
Getting Started
Clone this repository to your local machine.
bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/ML_project.git
Navigate to the project directory.
bash
Copy code
cd ML_project
Install the required dependencies.
bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Usage
Data Preparation:
Place your dataset named predictive_maintenance.csv in the project directory.
Data Preprocessing:
Run data_preprocessing.py to preprocess the dataset and split it into train and test sets.
bash
Copy code
python data_preprocessing.py
Model Training:
Run model_training.py to train a Random Forest classifier on the preprocessed data.
bash
Copy code
python model_training.py
Model Evaluation:
The trained model's accuracy will be printed.
Prediction and Failure Check:
Run failure_prediction.py to predict failure for a specific product ID.
bash
Copy code
python failure_prediction.py
Visualization:
Run visualization.py to visualize failure type distribution for each product ID.
bash
Copy code
python visualization.py
Reinforcement Learning:
Run reinforcement_learning.py to train a Q-learning agent for maintenance decision-making.
bash
Copy code
python reinforcement_learning.py
Notes
Adjust hyperparameters and settings in the respective Python files as needed.
Ensure your dataset is appropriately formatted and contains relevant features.
Refer to the comments within the code for further details on each step.
